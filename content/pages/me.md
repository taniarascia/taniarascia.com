I’m Tania Rascia, a full-stack software developer, technical writer, and former chef from Chicago. I currently work as a front end engineer for [DAIS](https://www.dais.com/), and I've also written for [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/taniarascia), [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/trascia/), [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/authors/tania-rascia), and [more](/publications).

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a [career change](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-i-made-a-career-change-into-web-development/). I [learn in public](/learn) and write about everything I know.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
